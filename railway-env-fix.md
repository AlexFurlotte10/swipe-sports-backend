# ðŸš‚ Railway Environment Variables - REQUIRED

## Add These to Your Railway Service

Go to Railway Dashboard â†’ swipe-sports-backend â†’ Variables tab

### Required Variables:

```bash
PORT=8080
JWT_SECRET=super-secure-32-character-jwt-secret-key-change-this
CORS_ORIGIN=https://swipesports.co
```

### Database Variables (Railway should auto-add these):
```bash
DB_HOST=mysql.railway.internal
DB_PORT=3306  
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=(auto-generated by Railway)
DB_NAME=railway
```

## Steps:
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Click on swipe-sports-backend service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add the variables above
5. Service will auto-restart

## Why Health Check is Failing:
- App needs PORT=8080 to listen on correct port
- App needs JWT_SECRET to start properly
- Without these, app crashes on startup
