# üé® Render Free Deployment Guide

## What's Free on Render
- ‚úÖ **Web service hosting** (free tier with limitations)
- ‚úÖ **PostgreSQL database** (free for 90 days)
- ‚úÖ **SSL certificates** included
- ‚úÖ **Custom domains** supported
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Sleeps after 15 min inactivity** (free tier limitation)

## Step-by-Step Render Setup

### 1. Database Setup (PostgreSQL - Need to Modify Code)
Since Render's free database is PostgreSQL, you'd need to:

**Option A: Use External MySQL (Free)**
```bash
# Use free MySQL from db4free.net or remotemysql.com
DB_HOST=db4free.net
DB_PORT=3306  
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=your_database
```

**Option B: Switch to PostgreSQL (Modify Code)**
```bash
# Change database driver in main_simple.go
# Replace: _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
# With: _ "github.com/lib/pq"
```

### 2. Render Deployment
```bash
# 1. Connect GitHub repo to Render
# 2. Set build command: go build -o main main_simple.go  
# 3. Set start command: ./main
# 4. Set environment variables in Render dashboard
```

## Better Alternative: Use Railway Instead
Render's free tier has limitations that make Railway better for your use case.
