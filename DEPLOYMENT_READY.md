# 🚀 Ready for Railway Deployment!

## ✅ **What's Been Fixed**

1. **✅ API Endpoints** now match your frontend:
   - `/auth/signup` ← matches your frontend exactly
   - `/auth/login` ← matches your frontend exactly  
   - `/profile/me` ← matches your frontend exactly
   - `/profile/update` ← matches your frontend exactly

2. **✅ CORS** configured for production:
   - Local: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Production: `https://swipesports.co`

3. **✅ Railway deployment** files ready
4. **✅ Environment variables** documented for Vercel

## 🚂 **Deploy to Railway (5 Minutes)**

### Step 1: Sign Up & Connect
```bash
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Choose this repository (swipe-sports-backend)
```

### Step 2: Add MySQL Database
```bash
1. In your Railway project dashboard
2. Click "+ New Service"
3. Select "Database"
4. Choose "MySQL"
5. Railway creates database automatically
```

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables
Railway auto-detects most variables, but manually set:
```bash
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-32-character-secret-key
CORS_ORIGIN=https://swipesports.co
```

### Step 4: Deploy!
```bash
- Railway automatically builds and deploys
- You'll get a URL like: https://swipe-sports-backend-production-xxxx.up.railway.app
- Your API will be live!
```

## 🌐 **Update Vercel Environment Variables**

After Railway deployment, set in your Vercel dashboard:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app
```

## 🧪 **Test Your Deployed API**

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/health

# Should return: {"status":"healthy"}
```

## 📋 **Your API Endpoints (Production)**

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Frontend Usage |
|----------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `/health` | GET | Health check | Testing |
| `/auth/signup` | POST | Create new user | `authAPI.signup()` |
| `/auth/login` | POST | Login existing user | `authAPI.login()` |
| `/profile/me` | GET | Get user profile | `profileAPI.getProfile()` |
| `/profile/update` | PUT | Update user profile | `profileAPI.updateProfile()` |

## 💰 **Cost: ~$4/month (Covered by Railway's $5 credit)**

## 🎯 **Next Steps After Deployment**

1. **Deploy to Railway** (5 minutes)
2. **Get your Railway URL** 
3. **Update Vercel environment variables**
4. **Test signup/login** from your frontend
5. **Add custom domain** `api.swipesports.co` (optional)

## 🆘 **If You Need Help**

The deployment should be straightforward, but if you run into issues:
1. Check Railway logs in the dashboard
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Test endpoints with curl
4. Check CORS settings match your frontend domain

## 🎉 **You're Ready!**

Your backend is production-ready with:
- ✅ **Database persistence** (MySQL)
- ✅ **User authentication** (Auth0 integration)
- ✅ **Profile management** (create/update users)
- ✅ **CORS configured** for your frontend
- ✅ **Scalable hosting** (Railway auto-scaling)

Time to deploy! 🚀
